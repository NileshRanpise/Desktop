Hi,

My Name is Nilesh.I'm React native developer

I have created this project in expo with typescript and material components.

this is Nasa Astroid details app

According to this assignment:

When the user will open the application, he will see the list of asteroids in the scrollable list 
which will be provided by NASA API.To get this list of asteroids, i have make a network call to NASA API to 
fetch data of asteroids and show it in flatlist. 

list has been arreanged as per decending order based on absolute magnitute atrribute.
If any asteroid is potentially hazardous, it will be highlighted in red,
i have implement loader while retriving the asteroid data the for user will see a loading spinner . 

When user select any astroids he will moved into that particular asteroid details screen there 
he can see all details about that astroid like id,name,absolute magnitute,minimum and maximum estimate diameter,is potentially hazardious astroid  ,
tha last time and distence it had close approach to earth and the next time and distence it had close approach to earth
The screen will also have a back to go back to our initial list.

I have used Jest for test cases.

Thank you !!
