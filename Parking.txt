Hi,

My Name is Nilesh.I'm React native developer

I have created this project in expo with typescript and material components.

this is a car management sytem app

According to this assignment:

when the user opens application there will be a two text input and 3 buttons. 
one text input for creating a number of lots and another for car registration number.
I kept create parking button,submit button and car registration text input disable till the user mension number of lots in 
text input field and there also have reset button for refresh data.

when user enter the number of lots in text input field and click on create parking button, 
it will create a number of lots and shows in the flatlist.

when user will enter car registration number and click on the submit button 
its randomly allocate the lot, If the parking is full it shows alert message as parking is full
and registration no also have unique unless it shows error for having same no.
Only the allocated lots can be clicked and able to generate bill.

for exit of car  
user can select his slot and moved into model screen where user will get one text input,create bill and pay bill 
button once user enter no of hrs car parked bill will generated

calculation for the parking charges for first 2 hours will be 10 dollars and then
after 10 dollars will be charged for every consecutive hour.

once by clicking on “Pay Bill” button, that lot will be deallocate and free for
another parking

then need to procced and he will be removed from parking slot.

I have used Jest for test cases.

Thank you !!
