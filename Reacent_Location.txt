Hi,

My Name is Nilesh.I'm React native developer

I have created this project in expo with typescript and material components.

this is Location manger app

According to this assignment:

When the user will open the application, user will see the two tabs first one for home screen 
and second for map of the location.here i have use react navigation for navigation purpose

In the home tab, the current location is shown on the top. And below that the list of recent location is displyed.

To get the user’s current location, 
1st we are collecting user device coordinates using expo location and 
then we are passing those coordinate’s to opencagedata API and implement reverse geocoding.

User recent location is automatically added to the list of location after every 5 minutes. 
user can see his most recent 30 location.

I have created two button for removing location
 1st button called 'remove' this button shown in with location itself for removing that particular location 
 2nd button called 'clear all' this button shown at end of screen for removing all location of user

I have also provided the second tab, which shows the recent visited location on the map. 

i have used jest for test cases

Thank you !!
